            "description": "To find the intersection of two sets, we need to find all elements that are in both sets. We can do this by finding the elements that satisfy both conditions: x ∈ A and x ∈ B. The condition x | ≤ 2 means that x is less than or equal to 2, so we can rewrite it as x ≤ 2. The condition √x ≤ 4 means that x is less than or equal to 16, so we can rewrite it as x ≤ 16. Therefore, we have the following inequality: x ≤ 2 and x ≤ 16. This means that x must be less than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 16. We can write this as x ≤ 2 and x ≤ 16. To find the intersection of these two inequalities, we need to find all values of x that satisfy both inequalities. We can do this by setting up a system of inequalities and solving for x. We have the following system of inequalities: x ≤ 2 and x ≤ 16. We can solve this system by adding the two inequalities together: x ≤ 2 + 16 = 18. Therefore, the solution to this system of inequalities is x ≤ 18. This means that the only value of x that satisfies both inequalities is x = 18. Since x = 18 is the only value of x that satisfies both inequalities, we know that x = 18 is the only element that is in both sets A and B. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is {18}.",

We can use the fact that the distance between the foci is equal to twice the focal length, which is given by the equation $c = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the hyperbola. In this case, we have $a = 16$ and $b = 4$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $c = \frac{16}{4} = 4$. Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = 8$. Since the line of intersection of the hyperbola and the line passes through the origin, it must be perpendicular to the axis of the hyperbola. This means that the angle between the line and the axis of the hyperbola is $\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Using trigonometry, we can find the coordinates of the point of intersection of the line and the axis of the hyperbola. Let's call this point $P$. Then, we have $\\cos(\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \frac{x}{4}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 0$. Therefore, the point of intersection of the line and the axis of the hyperbola is $(0, 0)$.

We know that the payment methods of each member are independent of each other, so we can write $p^k$ as the probability of all members using mobile payment. We also know that the number of people using mobile payments is $2.4$, and $P(x=4)<P(X=6)$, which means that there are more people using mobile payment than not. Therefore, we can write $p^k = \frac{2.4}{10}$ and $1-p^k = \frac{7.6}{10}$.",

We know that the focus of the parabola is at $(\frac{p}{2},0)$, which means that it is on the directrix of the parabola. Therefore, the distance between the focus and directrix is equal to the focal length, which is $\\sqrt{4p}$.

Now, we need to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane $ABC$. We can use the formula for the distance between two points on a sphere: $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$ where $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points. In this case, the center of the sphere is at $(0, 0, 0)$ and one vertex of the equilateral triangle is at $(2, 0, 0)$. The other two vertices are also on the sphere, so their coordinates are also $(2, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 2, 0)$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: $d = \\sqrt{(0 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane $ABC$ is $2$.",
