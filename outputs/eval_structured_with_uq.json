Given the complex number 2+i, its conjugate is 2-i. Similarly, the conjugate of 1-2i is 1+2i. Therefore, the conjugate of the given expression is (2+i) / (1+2i). Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize the expression, we get ((2+i)(1+2i)) / ((1-2i)(1+2i)) = (2 + 4i + i - 2) / (1 - 4i^2) = (0 + 5i) / (1 + 4) = 5i / 5 = i.\",\n  \"predicted_answer\": \"D\"\n}",
